        CTO and lead developer on a project to build a leading edge
        open source XML application server and content management
        system. AxKit is now one of the leading products in the open
        source community for building XML backed web sites, and has been
        used to successfully build many web sites providing alternate
        views for pages (such as WAP or HTML) and a friendly XML based
        development environment. The technologies built and designed
        by myself include XPathScript and the core engine inside AxKit.
        I also ported Cocoon's XSP technology to Perl for use in AxKit.

				access, installation, Object Orientation, Module design,
				and lots of internet API's. The project is slated for release
        in Q2 2001.

				initially with Visual J++, then with Sun JDK. Following on, working in Development IT
				doing internet/intranet development. Leading the development teams to create interactive
				business functionality. Key developments include large amounts of XML work, designing
				XML search tools (based on XQL and XML-QL), XML re-formatting tools (as a pre-cursor
				to XSL - see my web site), online XML editing protocols, and indexing techniques. The
				culmination of this work has been a global XML-based timesheet application, to be
				deployed all over the world to Ericsson employees. Some of this work has been made
				available to members of the Perl community via the Perl-XML mailing list and CPAN.

				Employeed again as a graduate I rapidly rose through the company, taking on
				projects such as a major upgrade for Searle Pharmaceuticals (mostly development work),
				Designing and implementing Comms security over RAS (working with the Win32 RAS and TCP/IP
				functions in C++), Internationalisation in the Oxygen
				application, performance improvements and internal tools. While working in
				Client Development I worked both on and off site for major corporations including
				Monsanto Searle Pharmaceuticals, Schering Plough, Lombard Business Finance, Astra
				Pharmaceuticals and Royal &amp; Sun Alliance. A major project
				while at ISS was developing their intranet. This rapidly grew from a project
				running on my own workstation, into a dedicated web server, serving up thousands
				of documents, and running some of the core infrastructure at the company. The server
				was a test bed for many new web tools - beta testing ASP (when it was called Denali),
				working with HiP Communications to bring Perl to Win32, and testing out the new IIS 4.
