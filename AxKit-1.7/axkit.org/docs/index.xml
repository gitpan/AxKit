				AxKit is a complex and powerful system, although getting started
				in AxKit is as easy as 1,2,3. The documentation here hopes to
				guide you through AxKit right from simple tasks such as
				transforming XML files using stylesheets, up to extending the
				AxKit application server to suit your needs.
			</para>
			<para>
				Please start with the getting started with AxKit guide. More
				advanced XMLers might be interested in XPathScript - an
				alternative transformation language to XSLT. If XSLT were
				likened to awk, XPathScript would be Perl.
