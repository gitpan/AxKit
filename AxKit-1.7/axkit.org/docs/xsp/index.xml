			XSP is an XML dialect for executing code in the web server that
			utilises embedded code, extensible tag libraries, and
			transformation techniques.
		</para>
		<para>
			XSP was originally invented for the <ulink
			url="http://xml.apache.org/cocoon/">Cocoon project</ulink>. By
			using their standard, scripts that are built for Cocoon are easier
			to port to AxKit (although its worth noting that Cocoon does not
			support XSP's written in Perl, nor does AxKit support XSP's
			written in Java at the time of this writing).
