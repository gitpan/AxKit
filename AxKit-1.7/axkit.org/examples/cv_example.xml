<title>Finally I get around to updating my CV!</title>
<p>
People ask me at least once a week to see my updated CV, but I keep it
on a different ISP's server and never get around to updating it. This
isn't because I don't want people to see it - but because I'm always
working on something far more interesting :-)

However I figured it makes a good example for XPathScript. So here is
<a href="cv.xps">the XPathScript source code</a>. The original XML file is available by
adding the querystring passthru=1 to the XML file. Link <a
href="cv.xml?passthru=1">here</a>. The passthru option is another
example of an AxKit plugin. The translated version created by this
stylesheet is available <a href="cv.xml">here</a>.
