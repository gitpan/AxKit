What to do if it all goes pear shaped...
========================================

If you have trouble getting AxKit working how you want it to work, then
please subscribe to and use the axkit-users mailing list. Details of this
are available at http://axkit.org/mailinglist.xml

If your problem is more serious, for example if AxKit segfaults, then
please follow these instructions:

Edit your AxKit's Makefile, find the OPTIMIZE line, and add -g to it.

Recompile AxKit (run "make test install")

Make sure apache is stopped.

run:

$ gdb /path/to/apache/bin/httpd
gdb version blah blah...
(gdb) run -X
  
Now make a request on your server. When it segfaults, gdb will stop and
tell you where... but I need more info... so type:
    
(gdb) bt
   
That will give you a backtrace.

Now email that to axkit-users@axkit.org, along with your Perl version,
Apache version, and AxKit version. It may also be helpful to include your
list of LoadModule lines from httpd.conf, and the section where you have
all the Ax* directives.

But please try the latest release of AxKit before sending it in - and if
you're testing a beta, please try CVS first (see the CONTRIB file for
details).
