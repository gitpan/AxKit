If I've missed anyone, please correct this list as my memory
is poor.

If you wish to contribute to AxKit, please join the axkit-devel
mailing list, by sending a mail to: 

    axkit-devel-subscribe@axkit.org

The list will show you all check-ins and allow you to discuss
the features you want, and how to go about implementing them. Please
bring things up there before randomly sending in a patch.

You can also access the AxKit CVS archive, read only:

    $ export CVSROOT=:pserver:anonymous@axkit.org:/home/cvs
    $ cvs login
      (just hit enter when asked for password)
    $ cvs co AxKit

Please only submit patches by editing your CVS copy, and then issuing:

    $ cvs diff

In the root of the AxKit tree. This makes it much easier to apply
patches. If your mailer isn't very friendly with spaces then please
redirect the output to a file and mail it as an attachment (possibly
gzipped).
