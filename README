Introduction

AxKit is a suite of tools for the Apache httpd server running mod_perl,
that give developers extremely flexible options for delivering XML to
all kinds of browsers, from handheld systems, Braille readers, and
ordinary browsers. All this can be achieved using nothing but W3C
standards, although the plugin architecture provides the hooks for
developers to write their own stylesheet systems, should they so
desire. Two non-W3C stylesheet systems are included as examples. 

The toolkit provides full intelligent caching, which ensures that if
any parameters in the display of the XML file change, the cache is
overwritten. The toolkit also provides hooks for DOM based stylesheets
to cascade. This allows (for example) the initial stylesheet to provide
menu items and table of contents, while the final stylesheet formats
the finished file to the desired look. It's also possible to provide
multiple language support this way.
