INTRODUCTION

AxKit is an XML Application Server for Apache. It provides on-the-fly
conversion from XML to any format, such as HTML, WAP or text using
either W3C standard techniques, or flexible custom code. AxKit also
uses a built-in Perl interpreter to provide some amazingly powerful
techniques for XML transformation. 

The emphasis with AxKit is on separation of content from presentation.
The pipelining technique that AxKit uses allows content to be converted
to a presentable format in stages, allowing certain platforms to see
data differently to others. AxKit allows web designers to focus on web
site design, content developers to work on a purely content basis, and
webmasters to focus on their core competencies. 

AxKit is based on components that are replaceable. This allows the web
site developer to create a completely custom XML Application Server
based around the AxKit API. AxKit can either automatically provide
caching facilities, or you can create your own cache handler, so that
XML transformations (which can be time consuming) only happen when
required. 

The toolkit also provides ability to build component based web sites,
and dynamic content. Database integration is fully supported, allowing
either deliver of XML from a database, or XML generation from a
database query. Dynamic web components can be built using the Perl
language, making the possibilities as infinite as CGI scripts, without
the potential mess that CGI programming can cause.
